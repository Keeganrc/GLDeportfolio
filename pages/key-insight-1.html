                            n today’s interconnected world, the ability to understand and navigate cultural differences is not
                            just a desirable skill—it’s essential for professionals working across borders. Whether managing
                            a team, building partnerships, or resolving conflict, success in international contexts often
                            hinges on more than technical expertise; it requires a keen awareness of how culture shapes
                            behavior, expectations, and communication. Through my participation in the course
                            <em>Cross-Cultural Behavior and Negotiations</em> with Professor Sali Li, I was introduced to critical
                            frameworks that help decode these dynamics, most notably Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions.
                            This academic foundation was later put to the test during my experiential learning abroad,
                            where I worked with a nonprofit in Scotland serving vulnerable populations. Together, these
                            experiences—one within the classroom and one beyond it—deepened my understanding of how
                            cultural awareness can enhance both negotiation strategies and interpersonal effectiveness.
                            This reflection explores the relationship between theoretical learning and real-world application,
                            highlighting how power distance and cultural fluency played pivotal roles in shaping my
                            international engagement.

                            n my course with Sali Li, Cross-Cultural Behavior and Negotiations, I explored how cultural
                            frameworks influence the strategies and outcomes of negotiations in international and
                            organizational settings. One of the most impactful within-the-classroom learning experiences
                            came through our discussion of Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, particularly the concept of
                            power distance. Through this lens, I examined how varying levels of comfort with hierarchy and
                            authority across cultures can shape expectations, communication styles, and perceptions of
                            fairness in negotiation. In cultures with high power distance, for instance, negotiators may defer
                            more readily to authority and expect less open disagreement, which contrasts sharply with low
                            power distance cultures that encourage egalitarian dialogue and challenge to status. This
                            concept helped me better understand why negotiation styles and behaviors differ so widely
                            across cultures and highlighted the importance of adapting strategy to fit the cultural context. It
                            became clear that successful negotiation in a global environment requires more than analytical
                            skill—it demands cultural sensitivity, strategic flexibility, and an awareness of deeply embedded
                            social norms.

                            ver the summer in France, one of the requirements of my program was to spend a month
                            engaging in work experience to gain a stronger grasp of working in an international context
                            while also contributing to a community of my choosing. I decided to spend my month in Ayrshire,
                            Scotland, working for a nonprofit called RecoveryAyr, which focuses on rehabilitating and
                            supporting individuals struggling with addiction, criminal records, and mental health challenges.
                            This experience pushed me to engage more deeply with a foreign culture without the support
                            system of friends or family nearby.                        
                        <p>One of the most tangible artifacts from this experience is a presentation I delivered at ESSEC
                            Business School in Paris, where I defended my experience in a Pecha Kucha format. The
                            presentation included photos from my activities with the group, such as working in a community
                            garden that provided ingredients for a weekly recovery diner, organizing a drug- and
                            alcohol-free concert for recovery communities across Scotland, participating in a Pride parade in
                            Glasgow to support LGBTQ+ members of RecoveryAyr, and preparing for a fundraiser by
                            crafting toys and bracelets to sell.

                            Scotland has the highest drug-related death rate in the EU, making the fight against addiction a
                            pressing issue. Through this experience, I participated in discussions about legal reforms and
                            community efforts aimed at addressing the crisis. Despite the cultural barriers I initially
                            faced—such as accents, colloquialisms, and workplace norms—I was able to adapt and
                            connect with the community, building strong, trusting relationships within the organization.

                            y experience in Professor Sali Li’s classroom laid the foundation for a deeper understanding of
                            the cultural dynamics I would later encounter in Scotland. Hofstede’s framework, particularly the
                            dimension of power distance, proved highly relevant in the context of my work with
                            RecoveryAyr. Although both the U.S. and the U.K. are considered relatively low power distance
                            cultures, subtle differences still emerged in the ways hierarchy, authority, and participation
                            manifested in daily operations. For example, while the nonprofit’s leadership encouraged
                            collaborative input, there remained a reserved and deferential tone in many workplace
                            interactions that felt more hierarchical than what I was used to in American environments.
                            Recognizing these dynamics through a cross-cultural lens allowed me to adjust my
                            communication style, balancing assertiveness with cultural awareness. This connection
                            between theory and practice reinforced that cultural fluency is not only about understanding
                            overt behaviors, but also interpreting the quieter cues that influence collaboration and trust in a
                            multicultural setting.

                            ogether, these WTC and OTC experiences offered a well-rounded perspective on how culture
                            shapes negotiation, cooperation, and professional relationships. In the classroom, I developed
                            the vocabulary and frameworks to understand cultural variation; in Scotland, I applied those
                            lessons in real time, often outside my comfort zone. The ability to identify and navigate cultural
                            distance—whether through power dynamics, communication expectations, or social
                            norms—proved invaluable. Moving forward, I feel more equipped to enter international
                            professional environments with both humility and confidence, knowing that effective
                            cross-cultural engagement demands continuous learning, empathy, and adaptability.
