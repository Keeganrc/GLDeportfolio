                            y name is Keegan Clendenin, and I am from Columbia, South Carolina. I am currently
                        pursuing a double major in Finance and International Business with a minor in French at the
                        University of South Carolina, where I will graduate in May 2025 with a Leadership Distinction in
                        Global Learning.

                        In the Fall of 2023, I had the opportunity to study abroad at ESSEC Business School in France,
                        where I focused on sustainability, leadership, and ethics in global business. This experience not
                        only strengthened my language skills and cultural competency, but also reaffirmed my interest
                        in the intersection of business, policy, and global impact. I’ve always had a deep curiosity about
                        how organizations function within broader economic and socio-political systems—and how we,
                        as future leaders, can drive meaningful and responsible change.

                        During my Sophomore year, I became a member of the Gamecock Consulting Club, where I
                        quickly assumed a leadership role in recruiting and preparing new members. I hosted casing
                        workshops, offered mock interviews, and guided peers through their first client projects. That
                        same year, I worked on a consulting project with Squadron Ethos, a startup company hoping to
                        monetise a niche community of aviation enthusiasts in South Carolina. I also collaborated with
                        ISI Consulting as a student consultant, providing advice on how to leverage their existing assets
                        and service team to put more projects in their pipeline.

                            y junior year brought new challenges and learning opportunities as I explored finance more
                        deeply through a role at Capital City Financial Partners. Working under a CPA and financial
                        advisor, I conducted stock evaluations, participated in tax consultations, and prepared for client-
                        facing responsibilities.

                        These experiences, alongside my coursework, have helped shape the professional I strive to
                        become. As you read on, you will find that my “Key Insights” include:

                            dditionally, my time studying International Business and French has reminded me that
                        effective leadership means more than delivering results—it’s about empathy, active listening,
                        and resilience. In the future, I hope to merge my passions for financial strategy, international
                        policy, and ethical business practices to lead with purpose in a global arena.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I have navigated work in sales, legal services, accounting, and construction, I’ve understood
                        that the path to success is rarely linear—but always rewarding when guided by values. My time
                        at USC has pushed me to think bigger, speak up, and embrace every opportunity with curiosity.
                        I’m grateful to the mentors, professors, and peers who have helped shape me along the way.
