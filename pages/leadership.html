                <h1>Leadership</h1>
                <p> When I was studying in France, one of the first great challenges my friends and I had to  overcome was breaking the ice with other students. While this might’ve been less of a challenge  back at South Carolina, the plethora of backgrounds, languages and disorienting moments all  while moving into an alien environment made acclimation all the more difficult. In fact, many of  the students that I went abroad with came back to the U.S very unhappy with student life  abroad, or more explicitly the experience of being an exchange student at an international  university. The ease of travel around Europe and the new experiences were certainly exciting, and we were all able to agree that certain aspects of being abroad were incredibly rewarding; however, only a handful of us can truly say that we enjoyed our time on campus. I was fortunate enough to have a French roommate upon arriving at ESSEC. This gave me greater insight into the customs and traditions at the university, as well as among the French students. I got to learn  slang that was only used by the French student body, and I was even invited to a few events  that were typically only for the French students, such as house parties and apèros. Knowing that  I was one happy exception to what is usually a very negative experience for others made me  grateful at the time, but I have come to realize now that this exception has put me in a  particularly advantageous position to help others have the positive experiences that I’m so glad I  got to live through. </p>
                <p> As I have harped on in my insights, Cultural Distance can be put simply as the gaps that become apparent between different populations on social, fiscal, governmental, and even  philosophical levels. These distances are what most often contribute to the disagreements and difficulties that arise when groups from around the world try to convene and work together at  cultural crossroads, such as the university my colleagues and I had the opportunity to study at.  The only tried and true way for one to overcome cultural distances is to first become aware of  the source of the friction and actively reconsider how best to approach a given situation when  two differing cultures are interacting with one another. For example, it is typical in French culture  to be slower to making friends than in the case in the United States. So, where a colleague of  mine would expect to have already forged a strong bond with another student, that student may  not have felt the same way about their relationship so quickly, which could lead to situations  where their actions would, in the eyes of the American student, be disrespectful to their  relationship. Small differences like these can exacerbate stressful situations for the side that  isn’t in the majority, such as being the foreign student exchanging at a university abroad. </p>
                <p>To combat this hinderance to the exchange experience, I my plan is to champion the creation of an integration task force at the University of South Carolina that would specialize in helping students learn about the opportunities and activities at their disposal here. This would give the students a more personal connection to the university during their exchange semester or year. From an international networking perspective, this program could also help the university negotiate new exclusive exchange programs for their students to continue to build the standing of USC as a center for International Studies in the United States. It’s important to note that the university does currently have a process for greeting international students and provide a brief orientation upon their arrival: <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/education_abroad/incoming_exchange_students_and_partners/">Incoming Exchange Students and Partners</a>. The focus of the task force, then, should be focused on ongoing support throughout the exchange beyond the boilerplate description of the university and gives advice and guidance tailored to our exchange students’ interests and goals.</p>
                <p>There are a few major steps to constructing this task force. First, while the task force should be comprised of university students, faculty advisors will be needed to act as a liaison between university management and the day-to-day operations of the task force. The students in this group should have some international exposure or aspirations in working with multinational groups, and it would help if they had a second language to help meet the exchange students in whatever language they are most comfortable. Second, the task force must coordinate with the school after the initial orientation has concluded so that they can begin tailoring their direction and emphasis to each of the exchange students’ needs and aspirations. This tailored experience can be as simple as compiling a list of clubs for students with athletic interests as well as one for aspiring leaders in student government, students curious about U.S history or politics, and even students who are seeking professional organizations and networking groups. Not only will this expedite the exchange students’ acclimation to university life, but the ties they create in these organizations will only serve to augment the network of every student, teacher, and young professional that they come across, creating a win-win scenario for the students domestic and abroad as well as the university itself. Finally, monitoring and oversight will need to be continuously upheld to make sure that the advice and guidance being given to the exchange students is aiding in their development as members of the Gamecock Nation. Key performance indicators to be considered will include but is not limited to surveys gaging the students’ satisfaction with their aide from the task force, the increase in number of exchange students engaged in student organization, and the growth rate of exchange students year over year from each of the universities we see students coming on exchange from. </p>
                <p>While this should not be considered a cure-all in the fight against student-university dissonance among exchange students, I believe it would serve as a necessary first-step in strengthening the university’s relations with its collegiate network and giving students from abroad the experience they yearn for and deserve when they come to one of the best Universities in the country! Next steps that may be considered if this process proves fruitful might be to charge this task force with going to the student organizations individually and schooling them on how international inclusivity could benefit them uniquely and how they can better recruit students that are on exchange.  </p>
