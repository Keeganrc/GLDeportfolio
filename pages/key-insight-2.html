                            s a student at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business pursuing a  degree in International Business and Finance, the first major lesson I learned was the inherent  value of diverse perspectives in the workforce, particularly in strategic planning and  management. In this insight, I will draw from my experiences in class with Professor Hudgens as well as my time performing in Italy with the University of South Carolina Concert Choir. In my studies on cultures and peoples around the globe, a frequent subject in business is how we negotiate our differing beliefs and values with our negotiations and cooperatives in international settings. If done right, these studies can facilitate brilliant and productive relationships that stretch from one country to another, but they also serve as a way for us to react and handle unexpected conflicts with foreign parties.  In this insight, we will discuss how a practical application of a well-known framework can promptly resolve issues that may arise when you least expect them, particularly in the moment where they are the most inconvenient.</p>

                            n Dr. Hudgens’ course, Globalization and Business IBUS 310, we were encouraged to observe and investigate how international commerce operates on a global scale. Through our readings, we explored how even the most  basic items—our tools, snacks, shoes, and phones—have traveled through multiple countries  before reaching our shelves in the U.S. While much of the class was practically focused on  global value chains (GVCs) and the logistics of international trade, we prefaced this practical  work with readings on different frameworks that companies use to evaluate countries when  making business decisions. These frameworks include the CAGE framework, which assesses the various aspects of a culture quantifiable on a scale, and the Onion and Iceberg models of culture, which highlight different ways to visualize the visible and hidden components of a culture.  These frameworks still resonate with me today and continue to shape how I view foreign cultures and multicultural experiences through a more objective and analytical lens. For instance, the CAGE framework allows me to adapt my behavior around different groups of friends to align more closely with the cultural characteristics they value. In a professional context, understanding cultural distance helps me navigate different environments and workplace expectations based on the culture they’re set in. </p>

                            n the Spring of 2024, the University of South Carolina Concert Choir took a trip to Italy to conduct an international tour. We started in Northern Italy and slowly moved down through the Tuscan countryside until we reached Rome, where we got to perform twice, once at the Vatican and once at another local church. Having visited Italy before, I was used to the food and methods of transport and was more than happy to be back. One thing I had not expected though was all the trouble we ran into upon arriving in the Vatican to perform.</p>
                        <p>Normally, when you perform at a venue, the person that is the liaison between the building / organization and the group performing does some quick introductions, shows you where to change and prepare for the show, and then leaves the rest to the director outside of queues and speaking to the audience initially to introduce the performing group. When we arrived, we were expected to either be Catholic or know all the Catholic rites and music from memory, which of course we did not. They didn’t even have scores or sheet music for us to look at while we were performing, so it was difficult. The recording I have on exhibit here is one of the Latin pieces we did prepare, which the church allowed us to perform during a designated segment of the Mass. You can probably tell from our faces that this was not normal or comfortable for us, as it all felt very rushed and unorganized given the scale of the performance itself. </p>
                        <p>What’s funny for me, though, is that I found all of this to be rather refreshing. Viewing Italy from a cultural intelligence perspective, the disconnect was obvious in that Catholics in Italy would expect EVERYONE, Catholic or not, to at least know the basic hymns in Mass. The resolution came, then, from everyone in the choir who was Catholic leading the charge on those pieces and singing out so that we could all copy what they were singing and how they were pronouncing it. The rest of us, on the other hand, had to be patient and tolerant to the discomfort until we got to the pieces that we did have a chance to rehearse.</p>

                            he concepts and frameworks we studied in Dr. Hudgens’ course provided a structured way to analyze cultural differences, but it was not until I encountered a real-world challenge in Italy that I fully grasped their practical importance. In class, we explored how businesses assess cultural differences using models like the CAGE framework and the Onion model, which break down the visible and hidden aspects of a culture. However, understanding culture in theory is very different from experiencing cultural friction firsthand.</p>
                        <p>When performing at the Vatican, I found myself in a situation where I was an outsider to the Catholic traditions that were deeply ingrained in the setting. It was not just about adapting to a different language or etiquette—it was about adjusting my expectations and approach in real time. Much like how multinational corporations must navigate unexpected cultural barriers in foreign markets, I had to rely on observation, adaptability, and the leadership of those more familiar with the culture to ensure our performance remained respectful and seamless. The CAGE framework, which assesses cultural distance in terms of language, religion, and norms, suddenly became more than an academic tool—it was a lens through which I could interpret and respond to the challenges we faced. Just as businesses leverage cultural knowledge to establish trust in new markets, we in the choir had to quickly recognize and bridge the cultural gap in order to fulfill our role in the performance.</p>

                            his experience reinforced a fundamental lesson: cultural intelligence is not just about knowledge—it’s about adaptability. While classroom theories and frameworks provide essential tools for understanding cultural differences, real-world interactions demand patience, flexibility, and a willingness to engage on others' terms. Whether in an academic, professional, or artistic setting, success in cross-cultural encounters requires more than just theoretical understanding; it demands practical application and an openness to learning from those embedded in the culture.</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, this experience will shape how I approach international business and global interactions. Whether negotiating in an unfamiliar market, collaborating with a multicultural team, or navigating unexpected cultural challenges, I will carry forward the lesson that sometimes, the best course of action is not to impose my own understanding but to interact on their terms—listening, learning, and adjusting to build stronger connections and achieve common goals.</p>
