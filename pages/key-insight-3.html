                            n my previous two key insights, we have discussed both the application of cultural frameworks on gauging preferred power distances and breaking down cultural characteristics within different populations to facilitate smoother interaction and cohesive group-work. Here, we will address a more practical, corporate perspective on global learning and its usefulness in the consulting industry. As part of my ongoing engagement with GCC, the Gamecock Consulting Club on campus, I take part in case competitions where me and my team conduct an analysis of a timely issue in real companies around the world and, using our business acumen and research, present a solution. More specifically, for the sake of this insight, we will review a case I did earlier this year and how global learning contributed a crucial component of our solution. </p>

                            n Joao Albino-Pimentel’s course, Global Stakeholder Management IBUS427-001, we learned to analyze and understand the multiple drivers of stakeholder management and sustainability in the global business landscape, conduct stakeholder and issue mapping and analysis, and assess whether stakeholder management and sustainability challenges can be addressed through win-win solutions or requires compromising approaches. We see evidence of this curriculum in syllabus where each learning objective is clearly outlined. A clearer artifact of my in-class engagement can be seen in the final paper, which I prepared in conjunction with a few of my peers. As summarized the executive summary listed below this paper was an exercise in incorporating stakeholder mapping and consideration into a comprehensive analysis on a crisis that arose with Shell in its attempt to exit Nigeria after an oil spill wrought havoc on local communities and ecosystems. In my contributions as lead financial analyst, I had to segment my cost/benefit analysis over several global stakeholders who were either impacted financially by the disaster, demanded reparations, or necessitated a response from Shell that had to be quantified financially. </p>

                            n the Spring of 2025 and late winter of 2024, a team and I with the Gamecock Consulting Club engaged in an International Case Competition that was submitted remotely with recorded presentations and prepared slides. In this case, we were tasked with devising a strategy for AWS services to increase revenues through Innovation and market development. I took lead on assessing the core capabilities of AWS and deciding what assets we could best leverage in our strategy and managing core weaknesses and potential risks. </p>
                        <p>In a typical case, you are usually focused on a particular country or region where the problem is taking place. With cases that are more open – ended such as this, however, we have the liberty to explore more global prospects within our solution and really flex our creative muscles.  If you go to minute 2:47, you can see how laid out AWS’s various services and assess where the most globally competitive assets lie in the company’s portfolio. In prepping this, I took into consideration things like global market trends, where AWS fell in the supply chains of their clientele, and existing agreements and partnerships. Keeping this global mindset at the forefront when preparing for this case competition was a leading reason why, out of over 1000 teams, ours made it into the top 25. </p>

                            he concepts and frameworks we studied in Joao’s course gave us a new lens as professionals when considering the status and position of a global company. Rather than pining over the immediate implications of internal decisions at the operating stages of the company, we were challenged to look not only at the company’s exact position, but how its decisions would ripple out on both ends of the supply chain. From the suppliers that the company deals with and the suppliers for those companies to the clients they service and the services those clients provide to others, the chain of stakeholders for any given global organization and how each of those stakeholders can affect the company is as essential an analysis as any internal measure the company could take.</p>
                        <p>As I moved through this case earlier this year, it was a recurring theme in our meetings to keep in mind that AWS is a primarily business-to-business company whose decisions can affect entire industries let alone their own bottom line. The capabilities of each of their assets had to be held to a different set of standards, as we were dealing in industry-standard technology rather than simply a new product. The international ties that are implicit in the decisions we make and the suggestions we provide to companies are as vital to the success of our case as our evaluations of the company’s core competencies, which is exactly the reason that they impacted them in my segment of the presentation.</p>

                            he integration of global learning into corporate problem-solving is essential for effective stakeholder management and innovative strategy development in multinational corporations. My experiences in both academic settings—through Joao Albino-Pimentel’s Global Stakeholder Management course—and practical applications—such as the Gamecock Consulting Club case competitions—demonstrate the critical role of stakeholder analysis, financial assessment, and global market awareness in navigating complex business challenges. By applying stakeholder mapping frameworks in our Shell crisis analysis, I gained firsthand experience in balancing corporate financial interests with sustainability and ethical considerations. Similarly, the AWS innovation strategy case reinforced the importance of assessing a company’s global reach, supply chain positioning, and competitive assets to drive market development. These experiences underscore the necessity of a holistic, globally informed approach in business consulting, where decisions must account for far-reaching stakeholder implications. Moving forward, the ability to blend theoretical knowledge with practical application will remain a cornerstone of success in global business strategy and corporate innovation.</p>
